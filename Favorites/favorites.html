      <h1>Anthony's Favorite Things</h1>
      <p>
        Anthony is an interesting person, well at least he thinks so. Below are
        <b>Anthony's favorite things.</b>
      </p>

      <h2>Cycling</h2>
      <p>
        Anthony loves cycling. He bikes any chance he can get. His favorite
        cycling routes are Shoal Creek for a quick morning ride and 360 to get
        out of Central Austin and get a good workout in.
        <br />
        Did you know that Anthony loves cycling so much that he

      <h2>The Beach</h2>
      <p>
        Anthony loves the beach. He grew up close to Galveston, TX, and was
        practically raised there. He was what the locals called a "beach bum",
        although he sucks at surfing.

      <br />
      <h2>Big Bend National Park</h2>
      <p>
          Anthony loves hiking. He was always outdoorsy, and visiting Big Bend is a 
          great way to hike while flexing his overpriced REI pullover. Here's Anthony in
          front of <a href="https://visitbigbend.com/santa-elena/">Santa Elena Canyon.</a>
